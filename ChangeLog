LEGEND
[bug]      general bug fix. This is generally a backward compatible change,
	   unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	   compatibility to fix the bug.
[build]    compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc]      update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func]     new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	   change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	   fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	   security patch releases.

*: Backward incompatible or operational change.
